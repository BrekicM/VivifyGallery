Hello, here are some details about my work. UI tests were written in Java/Selenium ChromeDriver using Eclipse, Apache POI was also used for reading data from an Excel file.

Automation task has its own dedicated class (AutomationScenario). I hope that I understood the task correctly, but if I didn't, I hope that you will appreciate the effort.

First test of the scenario verifies that a user can successfully log into the page by using valid credentials. Log in is asserted.

Second test of the scenario verifies that a user can successfully create an image gallery by filling out the required fields and uploading an image to the gallery.

Third test of the scenario successfully locates the created gallery in the "My gallery" section by utilizing the search button. Assert here also serves as a verification that the gallery was successfully created.

Fourth test of the scenario logs out the user and verifies that user is successfully logged out.

I tried to add as much variety to my work by using different locators and additional cases (multiple login cases, additional positive gallery UI case for adding multiple images with an additonal logoff test) that I found useful.

As for API part of the testing, I must admit that at the moment I do not possess the required knowledge to perform the test, as we barely touched the concept when we mentioned Postman in one IT Bootcamp class which lasted around 3 hours, but I am more than eager to learn it in the near future.
